# 📊 SQL Query Playground

This repository contains a growing set of practice SQL queries I've written to build and reinforce my understanding of data analysis, filtering, and reporting. These examples are based on real-world use cases such as healthcare scheduling, employee records, inventory management, and audit tracking.

---

## 🧠 What You'll Find

- 🔎 **Filtering & Conditions**: `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`
- 🔗 **Joins**: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- 📊 **Aggregations**: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`
- 📁 **Subqueries & Views**
- 🧮 **Data Analysis**: Calculating trends, totals, and audit metrics

## 🗂️ Example Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scheduling_queries.sql` | Queries for pulling patient appointment data |
| `employee_reporting.sql` | Filtering and analyzing HR data |
| `inventory_summary.sql` | Using aggregates to show low-stock items |
| `subqueries_and_views.sql` | Practice with nested queries and views |
